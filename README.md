# C++ Algorithms and Data Structures Practice
This repository contains my practice solutions to logical problems, algorithms, and data structures using C++.
The goal of this project is to:
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Improve understanding of data structures
- Practice algorithmic thinking
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Build a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals
All problems are organized by topic for better structure and clarity.
